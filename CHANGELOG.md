# Changelog

All notable changes to TracePilot will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project loosely adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.2] - 2026-09-09

### Added
- **GPT-6 Astra pricing** — Added the model and display-name alias, official input/output and cache rates, and the long-context tier above 272,000 input tokens to the shared pricing defaults.

### Fixed
- **Astra cost estimates** — Astra sessions can now use token-based AI Credit estimates when observed billing telemetry is absent, including cache-write costs.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed
- **Session Explorer file-content copying** — Restored the file viewer's copy-content action so file contents can be copied directly from Session Explorer (#785)

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-26

### Added
- **Exact Context Capture** — See the precise request payload sent to the LLM for any given session, including the full system prompt, tool definitions, and conversation history as the model received them (#773)
- **Builtin skill browsing in the Skill Editor** — Packaged Copilot CLI skills are now surfaced directly in the Skills Manager (#782)
- **Month-to-date time range for Analytics** — A new date range preset aligned to the current billing cycle is available across all analytics views (#782)

### Changed
- **"Experimental Features" → "Additional Features"** — The settings section has been reorganized into two groups: Recommended (Skills, Export, Exact Context Capture) and Experimental (MCP Servers, Session Replay, Copilot SDK Bridge, Config Injector, Alerts), with a clear stability warning on the latter (#781)
- **Lower default session cache** — The in-memory session cache now defaults to 10 (previously 30) and is user-configurable in Settings, with prioritized foreground loading and optimized prefetch (#778)
- **CSV export removed** — CSV has been dropped as a session export format; JSON and Markdown remain available (#780)
- **CI/CD pipeline optimizations** — GitHub Actions workflows restructured with dedicated composite actions for Node/pnpm, Rust, and Tauri Linux setup; improved caching, concurrency controls, and dependency pinning (#774)
- **Repository reliability improvements** — Pinned Node.js version, upgraded workspace dependencies, hardened external link handling, improved config persistence, and expanded test coverage across the CLI, UI, and Rust backend (#775)
- **Context Visualizer module decomposition** — The Context tab, context window builder, and session-DB parser were split into focused sub-modules with dedicated test suites (#779)

### Fixed
- **Release notes visible before downloading updates** — The What's New modal can now display changelogs for an upcoming release while the update is still downloading, rather than requiring the install to complete first (#777)
- **Context Timeline accuracy for subagents** — Fixed ownership attribution so main-agent context is no longer conflated with subagent context; added system prompt size estimation before shutdown and snapshot tracking across turns (#783)

## [0.7.1] - 2026-07-21

### Added
- **Session Explorer overhaul** — Safely preview raster images with zoom/pan, inspect JSON/JSONL trees, browse CSV/TSV tables with remembered format view modes, search session files by name or content with auto-expanding folders, find matches within open files, and expand large previews up to 16 MiB

### Fixed
- **Analytics, pricing, and chart usability** — Keep chart tooltips within the viewport, simplify AIC fallback pricing in settings, and refine interactive hit areas across Analytics, Code Impact, and Tool views (#751)

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added
- **Context Visualizer** — A new Context tab charts how session context changes by turn or elapsed time, separates system prompt, tool definition, and conversation tokens, marks compactions and session events, and ranks the tool types and individual calls contributing the most context
- **Session Explorer file actions** — Copy a selected file's absolute path from the viewer, or right-click files and folders to copy paths or contents and open their locations in the system file browser

### Changed
- **AI Credits are now a first-class cost metric** — Observed AIC now flows through session summaries, per-model and per-segment metrics, analytics, comparisons, CLI output, and Markdown exports; compatible historical sessions fall back to clearly labelled token-based estimates
- **Copilot CLI v1.0.71 telemetry** — Added tracking for usage checkpoints and session-limit changes, including context tiers and AIC caps, and corrected accounting for cumulative shutdown snapshots across resumed sessions
- **Copilot CLI package path compatibility** — Config injection and version discovery now resolve platform-specific package directories on Windows, macOS, and Linux, with a fallback to the legacy `universal` layout
- **Current model and pricing data** — Updated the registry with new Copilot models, refreshed AIC and token rates, and long-context pricing tiers selected by input-token thresholds

## [0.6.7] - 2026-05-17

### Added
- **Project Skill Discovery** — The Skills Manager now automatically discovers and surfaces skills encountered within your active projects

### Changed
- **Copilot CLI alignment** — Session names now read the new `name` field from Copilot's `workspace.yaml`
- **UI Refinements** — Improved timeline alignments, sticky headers for the subagent panel, and internal refactoring of Export and Analytics views for better maintainability

### Fixed
- **CLI Turn Snippets** — Terminal turn previews now safely normalize snippets instead of lossily stripping HTML

## [0.6.6] - 2026-05-10

### Added
- **Inline skill invocation rendering** — conversation views now show skill calls as dedicated session events instead of burying them inside generic tool activity

### Changed
- **Usage-based Copilot pricing support** — pricing settings, session metrics, analytics, and model comparison now understand the newer AI Credit / usage-based billing model
- **Better objective and cost visibility** — active session objectives are surfaced more clearly, and analytics cost series/distributions are easier to interpret
- **UI polish across core surfaces** — sidebar, search palette, session views, and shared tool-renderer chrome now feel more consistent and readable

### Fixed
- **Copilot CLI 1.0.40 compatibility** — newer permission-related events and payload shapes now parse and render correctly

## [0.6.5] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- **Custom storage path support** — setup and Data & Storage now support custom Copilot and TracePilot home directories, including custom session directories, without breaking session discovery
- **Richer tool-call rendering** — `apply_patch` diffs and `ask_user` prompts now render in dedicated UI components instead of generic fallbacks

### Changed
- **Live session viewing is more reliable** — Copilot SDK deltas render correctly, tool partial output now appears inline, pop-out windows keep auto-scroll behavior, and unnecessary SDK refresh work is skipped when the feature is disabled
- **Session metadata is more accurate** — indexed sessions now preserve Copilot CLI version attribution more consistently, with supporting SQLite schema improvements under the hood
- **Storage/path handling is more consistent** — setup, settings, launcher integration, and backend session discovery now share a centralized path model

### Fixed
- **Security hardening for detached terminal launch** — detached process spawning is now protected against command injection
- Nested folders now render correctly in file-browser trees
- Explorer tab width is constrained more cleanly, and disabled button states are more consistent and accessible across the UI

### Removed
- The experimental AI Tasks surface, including its task dashboard, preset-management views, and related backend orchestration plumbing
- Session health scoring
- The Token Flow Sankey tab

## [0.6.4] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- **GPT-5.5 model support** in the model registry and config injector
- **Bespoke syntax highlighter overhaul** — correct Rust lifetimes, TS template literals and regex-vs-division, JSX/TSX, YAML anchors; ReDoS-hardened with a bounded LRU cache

### Changed
- **Copilot CLI 2026-04 `settings.json` migration support** — config injector reads both `settings.json` and the legacy commented `config.json`, surfaces parse errors, and only writes user-editable keys back
- **Improved Copilot SDK integration** — bridge survives app reloads, pop-out windows can drive their own session, and assistant/reasoning deltas stream live in chat; clicking a system notification opens the matching session
- **More aggressive session preloading** — direct UUID path resolution eliminates redundant directory scans (was running 6× per prefetch); session caches grow from 10 → 30 to match the prefetch window
- **Tech debt** — continued backend module decomposition, typed `SessionId` newtype across hot paths, consolidated error taxonomy, expanded typed Tauri bindings, and new CI checks (CSP, doc links, ADRs, public-API baseline)

### Fixed
- Markdown bullets and numbered lists now render in chat (a global CSS reset was stripping list markers)
- Session File Explorer no longer flashes or scroll-jumps on auto-refresh; new sessions and todos are picked up between reindexes
- SQLite session-DB viewer: added Schema tab, resizable columns, cell-expand modal, and always-on headers for empty tables
- Subagent Panel consolidated into a single unified view with a chronological reasoning + tool activity stream

## [0.6.3] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- **Pop-out session windows** — open any session in its own dedicated window by dragging a tab out of the strip, or Ctrl+clicking a session in the list. Multi-tab session viewing with drag-to-reorder, keyboard navigation, context menu, and tab state persisted across restarts
- **Session File Explorer** — new Explorer tab in session detail lets you browse and view all files inside a session's state directory directly in the app, with type-aware rendering for Markdown, code, JSONL, YAML, TOML, and more; binary and SQLite files shown as placeholders; path traversal protected
- **System prompt visibility** — `system.message` events (e.g. injected system prompts) now appear as a collapsible panel above session events in the conversation view
- **Structured checkpoint rendering** — checkpoints with the standard XML schema now render with collapsible sections, section icons, and a raw/structured toggle; the checkpoint list is redesigned as a compact vertical timeline with expand-all; compaction events link directly to their associated checkpoint

### Changed
- **Session export now on by default** — the Export button is now accessible directly from the session detail panel without enabling a feature flag; new presets (Full Archive, Minimal Team Log, Agent Context, Full-Fidelity Backup), raw zip export option, and richer subagent metadata in Markdown output
- **Session indexing performance** — session event parsing now uses an LRU cache (keyed on file size + mtime) to eliminate redundant re-parses; reindex is debounced within a 2-minute window; FTS health and browse-facet results are cached, significantly reducing latency when navigating between views
- **Reduced SQLite allocation pressure** — SQL placeholder string generation now uses a single pre-allocated buffer instead of hundreds of heap allocations per batch; search filter helpers updated to match
- **Session launcher supports complex prompts** — the `--interactive` prompt argument is now reliably encoded on all platforms using PowerShell stop-parsing / Base64 decode, supporting prompts with quotes, backslashes, and newlines that previously caused launch failures
- **Tech debt: major codebase decomposition** — IPC hardening and Tauri capability scoping (main vs viewer windows), `runAction`/`runMutation` codemod across all 14 Pinia stores, `tauri-specta` type binding generation, `PageShell` layout adoption across 13 views, and comprehensive security hardening in the Rust backend (input validation, error scrubbing, safe path handling)

### Fixed
- Subagent model attribution corrected; a warning badge is shown when a subagent's reported model doesn't match the session model
- Rich tool rendering compatibility with real session data; several display regressions resolved

## [0.6.2] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- **AI Tasks** (experimental) — define reusable task presets with context-aware prompts, dispatch them through a Copilot CLI orchestrator, and monitor runs from dedicated dashboard, detail, and preset-management views. Enable in **Settings → Experimental**. Very rough implementation (not recommended yet)
- **Live session steering via Copilot SDK** (experimental) — connect TracePilot to an active Copilot CLI session and send follow-up messages from the chat view. Enable in **Settings → Experimental**. Prone to bugs - not recommended for use yet.

### Changed
- **Copilot CLI v1.0.24 support** — added coverage for new session fields including reasoning tokens, request IDs, and subagent performance metrics, improving compatibility and analytics fidelity on newer sessions
- Search and indexing are more robust — CLI search now includes assistant and tool content, while index DB maintenance and opening safeguards reduce bloat and improve refresh reliability

### Removed
- Deprecated `exportSession()` client API — use `exportSessions()` instead (same functionality, accepts a single config)

## [0.6.1] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Skills Manager** — create, edit, and manage Copilot CLI skills from the desktop; import from a local path, file, or any GitHub repository (including private repos via the `gh` CLI); IDE-style editor with live Markdown preview, YAML frontmatter editing, and an integrated asset browser. Enable in **Settings → Features**
- **MCP Server Manager** — add, configure, and health-check MCP servers with full Copilot CLI config compatibility; import server definitions from file or GitHub; browse available tools with expandable input schemas. Enable in **Settings → Features**
- TracePilot App Automation skill — built-in Copilot CLI `SKILL.md` for automating the desktop app via WebView2 CDP, with launch, connect, and smoke-test e2e scripts

### Fixed
- Session overview and chat now auto-refresh when background subagents complete; `read_agent` calls are visible inline and in-progress durations no longer show 0 ms
- Search facet and stats queries silently discarded results on SQLite row errors; errors now propagate correctly
- CLI showed a raw stack trace when `~/.copilot/session-state` was absent; replaced with a clean, actionable error message
- Chat scrollbar visibility; light-mode chart hover styling
- 9 missing CSS design token variables that caused silent visual regressions across multiple views

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added
- **Session Export/Import** (experimental) — export sessions to JSON (lossless `.tpx.json`), Markdown, or CSV with preset configurations, granular section selection, privacy-aware redaction (paths, secrets, PII), and live preview. Import `.tpx.json` archives with conflict resolution. Enable in **Settings → Features**
- **Conversation Chat overhaul** — subagent activity now renders as interactive cards with slide-out detail panels instead of inline tool dumps; progressive disclosure collapses tool-heavy turns; cross-turn subagent aggregation groups child activity under the originating agent; intent and memory shown as inline pills
- **Parallel session indexing** — sessions now index concurrently via Rayon with an optimized release profile and parser preallocation, significantly reducing initial and incremental indexing time
- **4.8× faster search indexing** — bulk FTS5 write strategy eliminates per-row trigger overhead for large reindexes (41 s → 9.3 s on 275 sessions / 327K rows)
- **Theme-aware shell renderer** — PowerShell and terminal tool output now follows your active theme instead of a fixed dark palette
- **Performance monitoring infrastructure** — tracing spans across hot Rust paths, IPC timing instrumentation, perf budgets, and bundle analysis CI workflow
- **Update check on startup** is now enabled by default for new installations — disable in **Settings → Updates**

### Changed
- Consolidated structured logging across the entire desktop app; silent catch blocks now surface warnings via `logWarn`
- Smoother loading screen animations tuned for faster indexing runs
- CSS design system: hardcoded colors replaced with theme tokens, refined micro-interactions and animations
- Search browse presets streamlined; duplicate search calls on pagination reset and view navigation eliminated

### Fixed
- FTS turn attribution now correctly matches reconstructor turn boundaries
- Missing or corrupt `workspace.yaml` no longer causes FK constraint errors during search indexing
- Markdown export: proper newline spacing between blockquotes; links open externally
- Shared formatters hardened against non-finite numeric inputs
- Chart tooltips restored; search first-run empty state properly styled
